    mankind through Genesis and Adam. 
    Beautiful story telling. New spin on the origin's 
    of mankind kind. Very vivid art and highly 
    relateable in terms of sacrafice.<p>
<h3>Ghost in a Shell</h3>
<p>I love this movie because of how it displays
     the potentail future of cybernetics and AI.
    It has very emotional story-telling and
    ia a crime, sci-fi, action, drama.
    Definetly worth the watch.</p>
<h3>Alita Battle Angel </h3>
<p>Again a super emotinal sci-fi film about an ancient 
    cybernetic warrior who defended  Earth before what was 
called 'The Great Fall'. The movie begin's with Alita

with the perfect amount of sci-fi.</p>
